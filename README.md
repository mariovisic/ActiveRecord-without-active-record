#### ActiveRecord without active record example codebase

Here is the code that I used to demonstrate the refactorings I made in my
ActiveRecord without active record presentation. There are two tags, fistly
`active_record` which is the codebase pre-refactoring. The second is
`without_active_record` which is the code post refactoring.

You can checkout between these two tags to get a sense of the refactoring.
